				<h1>Early Life</h1>
				<p> Beckham was born at Whipps Cross University Hospital in Leytonstone, London, England.[22] He is the
					son of Sandra Georgina (née West; b. 1949), a hairdresser, and David Edward Alan "Ted" Beckham (b.
					Edmonton, London, July–September 1948), a kitchen fitter, who married at the London Borough of
					Hackney in 1969.[23] He has an older sister, Lynne Georgina, and a younger sister, Joanne Louise. He
					regularly played football in Ridgeway Park, Chingford, as a child, and attended Chase Lane Primary
					School and Chingford County High School.[24] In a 2007 interview, Beckham said that, "At school
					whenever the teachers asked, 'What do you want to do when you're older?' I'd say, 'I want to be a
					footballer.' And they'd say, 'No, what do you really want to do, for a job?' But that was the only
					thing I ever wanted to do."[25] Beckham's maternal grandfather was Jewish,[26] and Beckham has
					referred to himself as "half Jewish"[27] and wrote in his autobiography "I've probably had more
					contact with Judaism than with any other religion".[28] In his book Both Feet on the Ground, he
					stated that growing up he attended church every week with his parents, because that was the only way
					he could play football for their team.[29]

				<p>His parents were fanatical Manchester United supporters who would frequently travel to Old Trafford
					from London to attend the team's home matches. David inherited his parents' love of Manchester
					United, and his main sporting passion was football. He attended one of Bobby Charlton's football
					schools in Manchester and won the chance to take part in a training session with Barcelona, as part
					of a talent competition. He played for a local youth team called Ridgeway Rovers – coached by his
					father, Stuart Underwood and Steve Kirby. Beckham was a Manchester United mascot for a match against
					West Ham United in 1986. Young Beckham had trials with his local club Leyton Orient, Norwich City
					and attended Tottenham Hotspur's school of excellence. Tottenham Hotspur was the first club he
					played for. During a two-year period in which Beckham played for Brimsdown Rovers' youth team, he
					was named Under-15 Player of the Year in 1990.[30] He also attended Bradenton Preparatory Academy,
					but signed schoolboy forms at Manchester United on his 14th birthday, and subsequently signed a
					Youth Training Scheme contract on 8 July 1991.[31]</p>
